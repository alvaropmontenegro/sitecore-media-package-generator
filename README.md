# Sitecore Media Package Generator
This Tool allows you to download large media content into small packages quickly. It turns the process faster and easier to migrate from one instance to another one.

## Overview
The goal of this script is to generate small packages, for example, divide a 3 GB of media content into 30 packages containing 100 MB each.
- The '30' is just an example, which means you can choose how big the package could be, which means you can have, 1, 5, 10, 30, 50, etc, packages. There's a parameter to set it up.
- When you divide one package into small ones, you avoid the Sitecore stopping working. You know that it happens sometimes when you are packing items and you lose all your work.
- When all the packages are done, you can zip them into one unique file and share it with everyone.
- You are able to see the progress of the whole operation.
- You can do an async operation. While some packages are processing, you can send the already-done packages.
- You can adapt the script to your own specific requirement.
