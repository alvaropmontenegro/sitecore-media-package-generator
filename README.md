# Media Package Generator for Sitecore XP
This Tool allows you to download large media content into small packages quickly. It turns the process faster and easier to migrate from one instance to another one.
As well as that, it provides another tool to install the small packages easily.

## Overview
The goal of this script is to generate small packages, for example, divide a 3 GB of media content into 30 packages containing 100 MB each.
- The '30' is just an example, which means you can choose how big the package should be, which means you can have: 5, 10, 30, 50..., packages. There's a parameter to change it. It's up to you.
- When you divide a large package into small ones, you avoid the Sitecore or IIS to stop working. You know that sometimes it happens when you are packing items and you lose all your work.
- When all the packages are done, you can zip them into just one file and share it with everyone.
- You are able to see the progress of the whole operation.
- You can do an async operation. While some packages are processing, you can send the already-done packages;
- You can adapt the script to your own specific requirement. If you need to change something, you are able to!
